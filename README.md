# Compressor_Decompressor
The compressor decompressor project in Java is a simple application that allows users to compress and decompress files. The project is built on Java technology and provides an interface to the users so that they can easily store and transfer large files. The project also provides encoding techniques in compression so as to ensure the security of the data.
The project aims at compressing and decompressing different types of files stored in our computer system at a particular destination location. There are four different algorithms that can be chosen to compress or decompress the files.

The four algorithms are:

Huffman coding: This algorithm works by assigning shorter codes to more frequently occurring symbols and longer codes to less frequently occurring symbols. This results in a smaller file size.
Run-length encoding: This algorithm works by replacing sequences of identical characters with a single character and a count of the number of repetitions. This results in a smaller file size if the input file contains long sequences of identical characters.
Arithmetic coding: This algorithm works by representing the input data as a sequence of numbers between 0 and 1. The numbers are then compressed using a technique called arithmetic coding. This results in a smaller file size if the input data is not evenly distributed.
LZW compression: This algorithm works by replacing sequences of characters with a single code. The codes are generated using a dictionary. This results in a smaller file size if the input data contains long sequences of characters that are already in the dictionary.

Technologies
1.	Discussion on two technologies used in the project: Java and Java Swing.
2.	Java IO package is used to handle input and output streams for reading and writing data to files or other sources.
3.	Input file is compressed and output file is generated using the Java IO package.
like buttons, labels, and texts.
4.	JFrame represents the main window when executing the project.
5.	The project includes a button that, when clicked, pops up a window to select a file to be compressed or decompressed.

The project is designed to be easy to use. The user interface is simple and straightforward. The user can select the file to be compressed or decompressed, and then select the compression algorithm. The project will then compress or decompress the file and save the output file to a specified location.

The project is a useful tool for compressing and decompressing files. It is easy to use and can be used to compress a variety of file types. The project is also portable and can be run on any computer with Java installed.
